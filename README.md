# Capstone I Project 
## The Messenger Application
This repository operates as my own environment while working on the messenger application.

The individual messenger application worked on solely by myself includes:
	1.) A BitBucket Pipeline for deployment
	2.) A Docker Image Implementation
	3.) Three Source Code Files:
		a.) ChatServer.js
		b.) messengerdb.js
		c.) index.html

The messengerdb.js file is the database connection for the chatserver program. It allows users and messages to be stored within the database.
The index.html file is the website's main page for login, registration, and chatrooms.
The ChatServer.js is the server file handling all of the backend of the program. Including handling chat messages, login/registration, and storing/loading database information.
